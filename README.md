# Docker and AWS combination

This script helps one dockerise an application with the correct files and then push it to Amazon Web Services's Elastic Container Registry. I used it during my summer internship which simplified the whole process. 

Run the file with the following command:

```python3 docker_aws.py```

The script will ask for the following inputs:

1. AWS configurations
2. Docker-related information

The script will then create the necessary files and push the dockerised application to AWS ECR.
